\chapter{Terminology \& Convention}\label{chapter:term}
In order to make clear of the potential ambiguity or unnecessary confusion over the words we choose to use in this paper, we list below the terminology and convention we use in this paper and their meanings:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Declaration}: A \emph{declaration} has either the form $x : A$ or $x : A = B$. The latter is also referred, rather frequently, as a \emph{definition}. Sometimes when we want to make a distinction between these two forms, we also use the word `declaration' specifically to indicate a term of the former form. 
  \item \textbf{Definition}: A \emph{definition} is a term of the form $x : A = B$, meaning that $x$ is an element of type $A$, defined as $B$. Sometimes when we want to talk about the components of a specific definition, we also use the word `definition' specifically to indicate the part of $B$, e.g., ``the definition of $x$ is $B$'' .  
  \item \textbf{Constant}: A \emph{constant} is the entity that a name or identifier used in a declaration refers to, e.g., the entity that $x$ in $x : A$ or $x : A = B$ refers to.
  \item \textbf{Variable}: A synonym for \emph{constant}. More often, the word `variable' is used to refer to the variable bound in a $\lambda$-abstraction, like the variable $x$ in $\lambda x . A$. In most cases, these two words are interchangeable. 
  \item \textbf{Name, String and Entity}: When we say ``the name of a variable $x$'' or ``the name of a segment $s$'', we refer to the string as an identifier that is used in the source file to declare this variable or segment. For example, if we have a line of text in our source file like this,
    \begin{lstlisting}
      x : A = B
    \end{lstlisting}
    then when we talk about it in discussions within this paper, we could say the \emph{name} of variable $x$ is ``x''. We use double quotes around the character `x' to emphasize that ``x'' as a name is a \emph{string}, whereas $x$ without quotes is the \emph{entity} as a variable that the name ``x'' refers to. Adhering to this notation meticulously is cumbersome when we talk about a list of names. So for a list of variables, say $[x,y,z]$, instead of denoting their names as [``x'', ``y'', ``z''], we simply say that the list of the names of these variables is $[x,y,z]$. 
\end{itemize}

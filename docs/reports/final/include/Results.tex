The result of the project is a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) program developed in Haskell where a file of our language could be loaded and type checked. The program features a static context and a dynamic context where the former is the context formed by loading a source program and can be extended by declarations from the user input; the latter serves as a buffer where the user can give names to expressions. Values of the constants from the static context cannot be changed while variables from the dynamic context can be bound to new expressions without restriction. The feature of the dynamic context, together with other commands such as \emph{hRed} (head reduction) are provided for ease of use to experiment with the definition mechanism built into the language. The source code of the program could be found at the Github repository: \url{https://github.com/WANG-QUFEI/Master-Thesis}. A summary of the commands provided by the program is listed in appendix \ref{apdix:command}.

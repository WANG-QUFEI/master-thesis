### Usage
  * To build the program, run command 'stack build' under the root directory
  * After a successful building, use the command 'stack exec -- siminitt' or the script 'run.sh' to run the application
  * Two files in the extra-sources directory, 'paradox.smtt' and 'seg.smtt', are programs written in the source language and could be used to experiment with the lock/unlock mechanism of definitions.
  * After launching the program, use command ':help' or ':?' to view the available operations of this program.
